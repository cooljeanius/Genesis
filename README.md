# Genesis
A Wesnoth campaign

*Twilight shrouds the frozen sky,
Where sunlight fades to silent night.
Beneath the blood sea dead souls cry,
Blind to blue moon's ashen light.
Impetuous force stirs blackened flame,
Erasing her forsaken name.
The iron crescent reaps all lives,
In dreams of darkness, spirit dies.*
