    description= _ "In appearance alone, the only obvious distinguishing feature between these demons and their lesser cousins is the blackened color of their armor. Physically, they are slight of form, not much larger than the average human. They are not possessed of great raw strength, no more than those of other regular demons, nor are they capable of harnessing their inner energies to produce gouts of flame and ice, like their other kin. It is because of this that these demons are often underestimated by their foes. This, of course, is a fatal mistake to make, for what these demons lack in brute power, they make up for in blinding speed and agility, cutting apart their enemies before any chance of retaliation is possible."
