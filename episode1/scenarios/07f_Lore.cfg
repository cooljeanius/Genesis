Along with their impressive set of defensive capabilities, each Guardian is granted a set of powers pertaining to each aspect, allowing them varying degrees of mystic and combative powers. Their strength is incomprehensible for most beings, even demon lords."

Powerful and authoritarian, she maintains strict order in her homeworld while steadfastly protecting her subjects as well. Legends state that humanity was created in her image on Ethea, but their perceived weakness drew the ire of the Urdemons. However, Uria decided to protect the fledgling race from its stronger predecessor, protecting the humans for long enough until they could live in peace with the demons. While the humans later spread to other worlds, the largest population of humans still exists on Ethea today. For these reasons, Uria is known as the Mother of Humanity."

Their homeworld, Norsula, is equally stormy and distorted by constant war with Shardia's cohorts.

In fact, it is only the Fae who can identify others of their kind on sight - possibly because they are more attuned to the uncanny nature of their being. Whatever the case, they are different, for they are neither the short-lived, mortal beings sprung from the Tree of Life, nor the appointed Guardians of the new universe, but something else altogether."

The details of this process are kept a secret; all that is known is that the Tree of Life became the foundation of the new world and the source of all its energies.
