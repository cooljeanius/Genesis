Along with their impressive set of defensive capabilities, each Guardian is granted a set of powers pertaining to each aspect, allowing them varying degrees of mystic and combative powers. In general, their strength is incomprehensible for most beings, even demon lords."

Powerful and authoritarian, she maintains strict order in her homeworld through her legions of Stromguarde keepers. Legends state that humanity was created in her image on Ethea, but their perceived weakness drew the ire of the Urdemons. However, Uria decided to protect the fledgling race from its stronger predecessor, sheltering the humans for long enough until they could live in peace with the demons. While the humans later spread to other worlds, the largest population of humans still exists on Ethea today. For these reasons, Uria is known as the Mother of Humanity."

Their homeworld, Norsula, is equally stormy and distorted by constant war with Shardia's cohorts.

It is said that, when she can be found, her presence is like the effulgent breath of life - vivacious and energetic, but fleeting.

When using their powers to their fullest potentials, a Fae may pose a slight threat to a weak Guardian, though it is rarely in their nature to brazenly seek combat. As beings composed inherently of magic, they possess a greater connection to their respective aspect than regular creatures and can thus perform feats that are usually limited to Guardians alone."
